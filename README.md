Manatee-Wordpress-Theme
=======================

A Wordpress Theme I've been developing for my Personal Blog

About this theme
=================
This theme is based on the _s wordpress theme template. _s is an incredible tool, having that strong
foundation is incredible useful. I also imported SimpleGrid.css to help with the site's layout. This was
my firt attempt at designing a wordpress theme, and I'll continue to update it as I will be using it as my
primary blog theme. A link to said blog will come shortly. As soon as I finish writing it.

Manatee's Future
===================
Thanks for checking out Manatee! The next version should be along shortly. It will add media queries to make
sure this theme is optimized for all platforms.I'm still tooling around with the styling a bit. I'm a
perfectionist so one minute I may like the layout/font/color and then the next I may hate it. Although, I have
been good lately so expect smaller changing that will strengthen the look of this theme rather than changing 
it.
